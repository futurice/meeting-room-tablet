Description
-----------
Reservator is an Android application for displaying and reserving meeting rooms. The application uses Google’s resources as meeting rooms. If you want to add a room to the application, you have to create a calendar for your resource and sync your account with the tablet. [Help for sharing resources](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1034381?hl=en) and [for creating calendars for shared resources](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/34584?hl=en). We recommend setting up a unique Google account for the tablet itself.

This application is meant for tablets so there are a few layout problems when using it on mobile.

Background
----------
This application was created as an internal project for [Futurice's](http://www.futurice.com) office in Helsinki and nowadays it is used at every Futurice office. It was open sourced as a part of the [Summer of Love program](http://blog.futurice.com/summer-of-love-of-open-source).

Reservator is now [available for free on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.futurice.android.reservator),
and we've [written about it in Futurice blog](http://blog.futurice.com/reservator) too.
